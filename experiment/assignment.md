## Assignment

<ol>
  <li>
    A circuit containing a resistor of <strong>20 Ω</strong> in series with a <strong>100 µF</strong> capacitor is connected to a <strong>220 V, 50 Hz</strong> supply. Determine the current and its phase with respect to the E.M.F.
  </li>

  <li>
    Construct a series RC circuit with <strong>25 Ω</strong> resistor, <strong>1 µF</strong> capacitor and an AC power source of <strong>50 V</strong>. Vary the frequency of the power source, observe the variation of current through the circuit and plot the graph between <strong>frequency vs current</strong>.
  </li>

  <li>
    In an RC circuit, <strong>12 Vrms</strong> is measured across the resistor and <strong>15 Vrms</strong> is measured across the capacitor. What is the value of the <strong>RMS source voltage</strong>?
  </li>

  <li>
    A resistor and capacitor are in series across a <strong>20 V AC</strong> source. Calculate the circuit <strong>impedance</strong>, <strong>Vrms</strong>, <strong>total current</strong>, <strong>phase angle</strong>, and the <strong>voltage across each component</strong>.
  </li>
