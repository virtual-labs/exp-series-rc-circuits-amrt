### Procedure

### Apparatus:
 Resistor, Capacitor, AC power source, ammeter, voltmeter, connection wire etc..


 <h2>Components:</h2>

<p><strong>Resistor:</strong> A resistor is a two-terminal electronic component that produces a voltage across its terminals that is proportional to the electric current through it in accordance with Ohm's law.</p>

<p><strong>Lamp:</strong> A lamp is a replaceable component such as an incandescent light bulb, which is designed to produce light from electricity. These components usually have a base of ceramic, metal, glass or plastic, which makes an electrical connection in the socket of a light fixture.</p>

<p><strong>Wire:</strong> A wire is a single, usually cylindrical, elongated string of metal. Wires are used to bear mechanical loads and to carry electricity and telecommunications signals. Wire is commonly formed by drawing the metal through a hole in a die or draw plate.</p>

<p><strong>Switch:</strong> In electronics, a switch is an electrical component that can break an electrical circuit, interrupting the current or diverting it from one conductor to another.</p>

<p><strong>Battery:</strong> In electronics, a battery or voltaic cell is a combination of many electrochemical Galvanic cells of identical type to store chemical energy and to deliver higher voltage or higher current than with single cells.</p>

<p><strong>Voltmeter:</strong> A voltmeter is an instrument used for measuring the electrical potential difference between two points in an electric circuit. Analog voltmeters move a pointer across a scale in proportion to the voltage of the circuit; digital voltmeters give a numerical display of voltage by use of an analog to digital converter.</p>

<p><strong>Ammeter:</strong> An ammeter is a measuring instrument used to measure the electric current in a circuit. Electric currents are measured in amperes (A), hence the name.</p>

<p><strong>Non-contact ammeter:</strong> A type of ammeter that need not be a part of the circuit.</p>

<h2>Procedure:</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Select the components from the right side of the simulator and make connections as shown in Fig:1 in the theory section.</li>
  <li>The connection is complete only when the black color appears at the end of the wires.</li>
</ol>
