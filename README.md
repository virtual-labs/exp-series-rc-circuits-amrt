### About the Experiment 

A series RC circuit is characterized by a time constant, typically denoted as τ = RC, where R is resistance and C is capacitance. The time constant represents the time it takes for the voltage across the capacitor to rise—or across the resistor to fall—to within 1/e (approximately 63.2%) of its final value.
