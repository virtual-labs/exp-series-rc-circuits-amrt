      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. This law is not related to electricity.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Lenz's law relates to electromagnetic induction.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Norton's law deals with circuit equivalence.",

        "a": "The average value of current is zero.",
        "b": "The average value of square of the current is zero.",
        "c": "average power dissipation is zero.",
        "d": "The phase difference between current and voltage is zero."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Average of a full sine wave current over a cycle is zero.",
        "b": "Incorrect. The average of square is not zero (basis of RMS).",
        "c": "Incorrect. Depends on circuit type (e.g., resistive has power dissipation).",
        "d": "Incorrect. Phase difference varies based on R, L, C elements."
